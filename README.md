# FSM Project

This project implements a deterministic finite state machine (FSM) in Python. It is designed to be modular, extensible, and reusable for various FSM-related problems. The project includes:

- A core FSM implementation (`fsm.py`).
- Support for transition events (`transition_event.py`).
- Pickling and unpickling of FSMs (`picklable_fsm.py`).
- An example FSM solving the mod-three problem (`mod_three.py`).
- Unit tests covering all functionality.

## Features

- Deterministic finite state machine with terminal states.
- Support for custom transition events and callbacks.
- Serialization and deserialization using Python's pickle.
- Comprehensive unit tests for robustness.

## Requirements

The project requires Python 3.7 or later.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

### Example: Mod-Three FSM

The mod-three FSM calculates the remainder of a binary sequence when divided by 3. Run the example with:

```bash
python -m fsm.examples.mod_three
```

When prompted, enter a binary sequence (e.g., `11010`):

```
Enter a binary sequence: 11010
```

### Output

You will see logs indicating transitions and the final state:

```
INFO: Starting FSM with inputs: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
INFO: Transitioning from 0 to 1 on token '1'
INFO: Transitioning from 1 to 2 on token '1'
...
Final state: 1
```

## Running Tests

Run all tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Sample Output
